            <h1 class="action">Veterans are <strong>TRULY</strong> special...</h1>
            <p class="action">Military veterans around the world are those special people who have taken up arms to fight. They have fought to protect their country and served to protect their loved ones. Even calling military veterans special for what they've done is an understatement, they are heroes who've put their lives on the line for others. These heroes are usually celebrated for what they do, and Veterans Day occurs once a year for this purpose. It is easy to appreciate what veterans do for us...</p>

            <h1 class="action">but they aren't <em>appreciated</em> enough.</h1>
            <p class="action">It's easy to focus on the accomplishments of military veterans, but their transition from war back into society does not get as much spotlight. Serving on its own is no simple feat, and it takes a toll on military veterans' physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Like serving, this transition back to society can be very difficult, as some military veterans return with "baggage" such as mental illnesses and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>
            <p class="action">Upon their return, they may not have a place to go to, so they may end up homeless. The stress from serving can affect their relationships with others, causing said relationships to break down. Most alarmingly, suicide risk is high for those who serve, stemming from being deployed, or having to partake in or witness killing. There's more of an emphasis on what veterans do over how veterans are affected by what they do.</p>

            <h1 class="action">The narrative for veterans can be changed...</h1>
            <p class="action">While there is not much attention on how veterans are affected by what they do, efforts are still being made to have it in a bigger spotlight. Many organizations are dedicated to supporting veterans, such as the Gary Sinise Foundation (https://www.garysinisefoundation.org/), Hire Heroes USA (https://www.hireheroesusa.org/), and the Disabled American Veterans charity (https://www.dav.org/) to name a few. We at team JC/DC created this website to spread awareness of this issue, focusing on the health and well-being of military veterans, and the challenges they face.</p>

                <div class="div2">"I have a lot of family members in the army, and their well-being is important to me. Seeing the issues that the vast majority of veterans deal with brings this issue close to home, so I want to spread awareness for this."</div>

                <div class="div4">"The mental health of veterans is often overlooked and played off as something minor. Thereâ€™s more to what veterans do than just serving the country, their well-being before, during, and after their service is important, and I hope we can bring awareness to this."</div>
